# Medical-data-extraction
As a medical researcher, I'm interested in exploring the feasibility of developing AI tools capable of extracting specific information, in addition to all the tables and numerical data contained within PDF files representing research papers. I believe such a project could offer substantial value to the research community and potentially be profitable if successfully developed.
Please give me insight on the topic and if you can develop such a tool so we can work together
